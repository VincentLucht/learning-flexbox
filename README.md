# learning-flexbox
This are just the assignments from The Odin Project

- learned that ul's are basically their own flex container, have to make them a flex container so that the list is not vertical
- learned a lot about how to use flexbox: how to do basic things like centering a div, using properties with their respective values, like justify-content: space-between; etc
